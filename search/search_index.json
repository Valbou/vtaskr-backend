It's a good opportunity to use best development practices like: Hexagonal Architecture, modularity, clean code, test coverage etc... And it's a good opportunity to make it open source. I aim to keep this project stable and reactive to stay efficient in use. The backend part is not just a REST API, it's the core providing services. It can be used via API, CLI, Email, Telegram etc... Maintainers The only maintainer at this stage is me: Valentin BOUVAREL alias Valbou. The project is developed (too slowly) during my personal time. If you want to contribute, you can help me in some ways: - giving feedback - creating code - writing tests - writing translations - filling out documentation - etc...
