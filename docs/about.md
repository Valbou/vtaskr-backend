# About vTaskr

vTaskr is initially a simple personal python project to replace a 15 years old PHP private project manager.  

It's a good opportunity to use best development practices like: Hexagonal Architecture, modularity, clean code, test coverage etc...  
And it's a good opportunity to make it open source.  

I aim to keep this project stable and reactive to stay efficient in use.  
The backend part is not just a REST API, it's the core providing services. It can be used via API, CLI, Email, Telegram etc...  

## Maintainers

The only maintainer at this stage is me: Valentin BOUVAREL alias Valbou.  
The project is developed (too slowly) during my personal time.  

If you want to contribute, you can help me in some ways:  
- giving feedback
- creating code
- writing tests
- writing translations
- filling out documentation
- etc...
